Sketch 1: This a pretty generic robot arm that consists of 1 main gear and 3 point joints. The reason I chose this one was because I like the simple design of it. Keeps me thinking on 
how I could imporve the desing and add small details instead of fousing on the specifics of the robot pieces. 
Sketch 2: Probably my favorite out of the 3 sketches. I found ispiration for this arm from my trip from japan. I saw a real life version of this arm but added my own twist to the arm
I feel that it works on some of my goals and I feel that the complication that it brings comes with a nice challenge. 
Sketch 3: This one I was brainstorming to see if I could make an arm that has multiple bend points. This on paper seems cool but the desing is quite simple. I feel that it could be better 
but not bad overall.
