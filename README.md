Sketch 1: This is a generic robot arm with 1 main gear and 3-point joints. The reason I chose this one was because I like the simple design of it. It keeps me thinking on 
how I could improve the design and add small details instead of focusing on the specifics of the robot pieces. 
Sketch 2: Probably my favorite out of the 3 sketches. I found inspiration for this arm from my trip to Japan. I saw a real-life version of this arm but added my twist to the arm
I feel that it works on some of my goals and I feel that the complication that it brings comes with a nice challenge. 
Sketch 3: This one I was brainstorming to see if I could make an arm that has multiple bend points. This on paper seems cool but the design is quite simple. It could be better 
but not bad overall.


During the modeling process, I chose to kinda follow a rigging/modeling process. I started by creating the skeleton during joints and adding points to it. I did add some detail but I didn't want to 
overdo it. I did try to work on parenting and it sorta of worked but at some points it did not want to follow also I need to work on my pivot points which I felt that I changed pretty well. Overall the
creative process is to add more detail later but understand what I'm trying to learn first before I get into the nitty gritty.

Adding some final details to the robot arm I felt that it came out pretty good. Overall I did add some bevels, batteries, and other details to the robot. Some challenges that I came across were mainly the clean up there are a few 2 parts towards the front that I tried to fix the lines but it did not work. But it's not a huge issue. 

With the final steps of the robot arm, I decided to go with an Iron Man-themed arm with the core on top and gold and red accents to it. I really did enjoy the UV's process and seeing the final process of the arm in 
general. I did run into a problem with Sketchfab that I will ask in class but after some digging in it might have to do with the joints and rig in general that might have constraints and it won't let me export it 
from Maya. But overall really fun!
